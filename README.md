# Attrition Analysis with Machine Learning.

The idea of the abstract is to let the organization gain an insight of what is happening with the employees of the organization, Recognize and understand what factors are associated with employee turnover, also employee and organization's increased productivity and growth

## Business Problem

Company 'X', A multi-million dollar company is about to go bankrupt and Management wants to know why his employees are leaving.

The company wants to understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover and to create a model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not. The goal is to create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees. Overall, the implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.

## Backend Platforms

## Anaconda

 Anaconda is the world’s most popular Python data science platform. Anaconda, Inc. continues to lead open source projects like Anaconda, NumPy and XGBoost that form the foundation of modern data science.

Installation: 

       wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh 
       
 This is the executable of the Anaconda Framework
       
       ./Anaconda2-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
       
 Already a lot of modules get installed by Anaconda by default, some of which includes:
 
NumPy  Base N-dimensional array package
SciPy library Fundamental library for scientific computing
Matplotlib Comprehensive 2D Plotting
IPython  Enhanced Interactive Console
Sympy  Symbolic mathematics
pandas  Data structures & analysis
XGBoost  An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.
